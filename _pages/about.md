I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors. I'm funded by the [National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Dr Lois Kim](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-research-staff/lois-kim/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

You can learn more about my academic, professional, and creative background by exploring this site. If you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, make a suggestion, or talk about the weather, please get in touch via the sidebar links!

Alternatively, if you're in Cambridge, come say hi at the Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute ([HLRI](https://www.hlri.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) near Addenbrooke's Hospital 😀
