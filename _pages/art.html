  <summary style="margin-left:2em">‚Äî there is the home key</summary> 
  <p style="margin-left:3em">
I struck my first note and the room‚Äôs silence swelled<br>
from the antiseptic dispenser hazard-red on the wall<br> 
to the reception‚Äôs almost-spring bouquets ‚Äì there<br>
you were cradling your coffee cup with not a word<br>
to each other or me and I tuned and wondered<br>
how you knew her and if you awoke together<br>
and for how long and who you kept vigil for<br>
and how to spell their name and how you<br>
spoke the name only you knew them by<br>
and where sundays mostly found them.<br><br>

During the chorus I looked up ‚Äì there<br>
you were holding your little one up high<br>
and our eyes drew together and I sparkled<br>
with mine and I turned the page wondering<br>
how many nursery rhymes covered the miles<br>
to here where he sits taller than your sighs<br>
on your shoulders ever-enchanted by your<br>
smiling bright and what that smile had<br> 
swallowed from words too wide<br> 
to unknowns that seemed always wider.<br><br>

I reached the softest section ‚Äì there<br>
you were as the double doors gave way<br>
to the figures who carried you into their<br>
flashing carriage in the middle of supper<br>
with your reading specs and today‚Äôs paper<br>
and I let the strings ring and wondered<br>
what the table you just set was like ‚Äî<br>
the one they wrested you from tonight<br>
as you sat in garments you thought<br>
only your home would keep in sight.<br><br>

In a music theory class I left long ago<br>
they called home the key you depart from<br> 
and the one landing your stories safe so<br>
let me stop my wondering and tell this story<br>
so this hazard-red room may feel like another<br>
and if you listen for a second with a stranger<br>
I may stop your unknowns from growing wider<br>
and when I strike my last note in the final measure<br>
to dismiss the wailing carriages that flicker ‚Äì there<br>
is the home key and we will come home together.

  <summary style="margin-left:2em">chicken soup</summary> 
  <p style="margin-left:3em">
this kitchen is mine tonight<br>
so I make chicken soup<br><br>

I coax two garlic cloves<br>
from their coats<br>
for it is spring<br>
and sprinkle rapeseed oil<br>
to make a coat<br>
for my years-scratched pot<br><br>

drop one clove<br>
on the ground<br>
(for dramatic effect)<br>
and slice the other<br>
as thin as I dare<br>
then thinner<br><br>

wrestle chicken legs<br>
from the icebox shelf<br>
then remove their skin<br>
and thank all the world<br>
that I will never<br>
become a surgeon<br><br>

submerge these contents<br>
in cold tap water<br>
then proclaim this<br>
‚Äúsoup‚Äù<br>
and no one shall argue<br>
but before service:<br><br>

gather green beans<br>
in a line like primary school<br>
then trim their toenails<br>
and wield almost-two carrots<br>
for their waxing appointment<br>
then slice into discs<br><br>

curate four potatoes<br>
with all manners of blemishes<br>
then quarter and halve<br>
for in this crowding pot<br>
they will become whole<br>
(also they should be rinsed forgot that part sorry)<br><br>

select one small capsicum<br>
that looks most harmless<br>
and add its peel and flesh<br>
and seeds and all and<br>
soon my fingers burn<br>
and my tongue doubly so<br><br>

season with trepidation<br>
and then with vigour<br>
and also with salt<br>
and then with pepper<br>
and leave the pot<br>
no matter the temptation<br><br>

this kitchen was mine tonight<br>
so I made chicken soup

can you believe that we walked for<br>
one<br>
and<br>
a<br>
half<br>
miles on the highway on slippingautumnleaves and<br>
puddles glistening with<br>
every strobe of headlights<br>
under the fickle painted sky<br>
until the sun closed the door<br>
on its way out<br>
and<br>
every<br>

to tube station salvation?<br><br>

friendship is being drenched and nourished and blinded and saved.

He scoured the shelves<br>
of seeded buns and loaded loaves<br>
like an ostrich, dilly-dallying, dignified.<br>
His lofty frame held a dress shirt<br>
and dark bright eyes under flowing dreadlocks.<br>
I crouched alongside him,<br>
examining the same baked wares.<br>
"'Scuse me", said a gruff voice<br>
out of thin, stale, grocery-closing-time air.<br>
"Do you know what day it is?"<br>
"Me? Of course! It's -- "<br>
Forgetting my pandemic rituals,<br>
I summoned my cell's home screen,<br>
deciphering, decrying this fatal germ invitation.<br>
"It's the tenth!"<br>
"See, ha. You don't know it either!",<br>
he quipped.<br>
We returned to the best before's and use by's.<br>
I waited behind him in line<br>
and we never spoke again.<br>
I thanked the security guard<br>
and faced bustling Chapel Market<br>
smelling the ocean and the toasty sun,<br>
wondering how I smiled so big<br>
to the stranger who stripped me of the illusion<br>
that I had myself together.
